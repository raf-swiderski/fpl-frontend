## About The Project

There are many great Team Builders out in the FPLmosphere; however, I didn't find one that that had the metrics I wanted. So I created this

The main idea is to represent true player value.
### All positions (i.e. Defender, Midfielder) have a minimum spend 
This means that you have to spend a delicious chunk of your team budget on a 4.5m Everton midfielder who is going to sleep on your bench for the whole season, simply because he is the cheapest. If you take away all of these minimum spends on each player based on their position, I believe this represents true player value. 

### Example

Coming soon.
<!-- 
Say defender `X` has a value of `£7.5m`.

Seems expensive, right?

The value of the least expensive defender in the game has a value usually around `£4.0`

Subtract this from the defender and you have `£3.5m` -->
